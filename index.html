          <p>What good are documents?<br />Or: Why not just human sources?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>Documents are useful because they:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Are usually attributed to someone.</li>
            <li>Usually have specific dates, carry metadata, etc.</li>
            <li>Are often contemporaneous to the events they’re capturing.</li>
            <li>Give insight into a person or organization’s thinking.</li>
            <li>Often point to new reporting avenues worth pursuing.</li>
            <li>Are often more reliable than human sources.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p><strong>The document state of mind:</strong></p>
          <p><em>“Developing a document state of mind means constantly wondering what documents are out there and laying the groundwork to get them. Reporters who can start seeing the world this way empower themselves and open a whole new universe of possibilities.”</em></p>
          <p style="font-size: 0.7em;">Note: If you’re curious to learn more, <a href="https://us.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/104722_Ch1_257467.pdf">this chapter is useful</a>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>While reporting, always bear in mind: Most things are documented, to some extent.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <ul class="r-fit-text">
            <li>Government and regulatory documents (open or via FOI)</li>
            <li>Securities filings for publicly-traded companies</li>
            <li>Corporate filings (incorporation, directors, sometimes ownership)</li>
            <li>Court filings (lawsuits, criminal cases, reviews, court-mandated orders like evictions, etc.)</li>
            <li>Bankruptcy records</li>
            <li>Political donations</li>
            <li>Property records</li>
            <li>Liens (outstanding debts on cars, homes, businesses, etc.)</li>
            <li>Social media</li>

        <section>
          <p><strong>Q: Okay, but how do you find documents?</strong></p>
          <p>A: You’re a document detective. You’ll need to think deductively and inductively.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p><strong>Deduction</strong></p>
          <p>Starting with a <span class="highlight-sky">hypothesis</span> and testing it through <span class="highlight-burgundy">evidence</span>. Top-down.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="example">
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>You receive a tip that <span class="highlight-sky">a city councillor is accepting gifts in exchange for favourable zoning decisions</span>. To test that theory, you might first collect <span class="highlight-burgundy">all decisions that this councillor brought forward or voted on</span>. Then, you might ask: Which companies benefited from those decisions? Then, see if there are connections between the company and the councillor on <span class="highlight-burgundy">Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.</span> You could also <span class="highlight-burgundy">FOI the councillor’s itinerary, their email correspondence (using the company names as keywords, etc.)</span>.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p><strong>Induction</strong></p>
          <p>Starting with <span class="highlight-burgundy">observations</span> and arriving at a <span class="highlight-sky">hypothesis</span>. Bottom-up.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="example">
          <p>Example</p>
          <p>For fun, you have been using a browser extension to scrape <a href="https://gtaupdate.com/">GTA Update</a>, a website that <span class="highlight-burgundy">lists police and fire calls for service</span>. While analyzing the data, you notice several calls in recent months to a downtown construction site. <span class="highlight-sky">You wonder if they have a workplace safety problem</span>. You learn the <span class="highlight-burgundy">WSIB has a “safety check” service</span>, and find the company has a  <span class="highlight-burgundy">higher injury rate</span> than some other local companies of similar size. Next, you <span class="highlight-burgundy">interview current and former workers</span>, and find out <span class="highlight-burgundy">this began when the company was bought out two years ago</span> by a private equity firm, so you pull their <span class="highlight-burgundy">corporate filings</span>… And on it goes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>In practice, you won’t use just induction or deduction. You’ll use both and jump back and forth between them on any given story. A hypothesis begets records, which beget observations, which beget new hypotheses, etc.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <p>You don’t need to know everything about what kinds of documents are out there to have a “document state of mind.” You just need to think about what information a person or organization is leaving behind.</p>
          <p><strong>To that point, another useful technique:<br />The “circle of light.”</strong></p>

            <p>Evictions</p>
            <p>Given the national housing shortage, you <span class="highlight-sky">wonder if more people are getting evicted in Ontario than in past years</span>. After some quick searching, you learn the province doesn’t seem to track evictions.</p>

          <p>A legal mechanism that allows you to make official requests for records held by public bodies.</p>
          <p>FOI exists for the sake of transparency, yes, but also out of operational necessity. Sometimes, you might need a government document for something in your own life. This is often the way to get it.</p>

        <section>
          <p>Most countries have some kind of FOI/access law. Many have several!</p>
          <p>This is the case in Canada. We have one set of laws per jurisdiction, meaning we have at least one law for each province and territory, plus the federal government. (Some jurisdictions, incl. Ontario, have two laws: One for provincial bodies, and one for municipal bodies.)</p>
          <p>The feds split privacy and access into two laws.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <p>This varies by jurisdiction. Many places charge a filing fee, often $5. Others charge nothing.</p>
          <p>Most jurisdictions may charge additional processing fees before you receive your records.</p>
          <p>Some jurisdictions waive fees for journalists, academics, etc. In practice, I find this is almost never worth it in Canada, as the waiver process can take months.</p>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>If you don’t agree with a redaction, time extension or other decision, you can appeal.</li>
            <li>Every jurisdiction has an appeal mechanism.</li>
            <li>Appeals are almost always free, except for in Ontario, which has a $25 filing fee.</li>
            <li>Most jurisdictions have an information commissioner or ombudsman who can review decisions.</li>
            <li>Some jurisdictions have a tribunal — an FOI court.</li>
            <li>Appeals can take a long time. In Canada, they can easily take several months, if not years.</li>

            Secret Canada was an exhaustive examination of Canada’s broken FOI systems, and the
            culmination of 18 months of investigative work. <strong>More than 1,000 FOIs, 200+
              interviews and 100+ stories, blog posts and newsletters</strong>.

          <p><strong>Investigation</strong></p>
          <p>
						Our reporting revealed that public institutions skirt FOI laws by overusing redactions,
						failing to meet legislated timelines and claiming “no records” exist when they do.
						And these institutions face few – if any – consequences for ignoring the precedents
						set by courts and information commissioners.

          <p>I spent <strong>a lot</strong> of time speaking with FOI experts across Canada. Several general trends jumped out:</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <ul>
            <li>Public bodies have embraced a risk mitigation approach to FOI.</li>
            <li>Access teams are under-resourced almost everywhere.</li>
            <li>Many public bodies don’t give much thought to their duty to assist.</li>
            <li>Redactions are supposed to be used sparingly and specifically. Instead, they’re painted with a wide brush.</li>
            <li>The appeals system has been captured by lawyers and legal thinking. I recently received more than 700 pages of representations for an appeal in B.C. That’s crazy!</li>
          </ul>
